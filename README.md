This repository belongs to the paper: [A Comprehensive Survey on Knowledge Distillation]().

## üìù Abstract
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved notable performance in the fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing with various applications in both academia and industry. However, with recent advancements in DNNs, models with a huge number of parameters, and the emergence of transformer models, deploying these large models on edge devices causes serious issues such as high runtime and high memory consumption. This is especially concerning with the recent large-scale Foundational Models (FM), Vision-Language Models (VLM), and Large Language Models (LLM). Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the prominent techniques proposed to address the aforementioned problems using a Teacher-Student architecture. More specifically, a lightweight student model is trained using additional knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model. In this work, a comprehensive survey of knowledge distillation methods is proposed. This includes reviewing knowledge distillation from different aspects: the source of distillation, distillation schemes, distillation algorithms, distillation by modalities, applications of distillation, and comparison among existing methods. In contrast with most existing surveys, which are either outdated or simply update former surveys by adding new references, this work proposes a comprehensive survey with a new point of view and representation structure  that categorizes and investigates the most recent methods in knowledge distillation. Various subcategories are considered whose necessity is critical nowadays. This includes KD for: diffusion models, 3D inputs, foundational models, transformers, and LLMs. Furthermore, existing challenges in KD and possible future research directions are discussed.
